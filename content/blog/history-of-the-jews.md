Summary: First book of 2016

Most of the books I read in 2015 were of the 200-300 page variety. I love reading but I also find myself distractingly looking forward to my next book before I finish my current one. As such, picking up this 600 page book with very tiny print felt like the equivalent of running a marathon when you are generally doing 5ks. There was a masochistic element, as well as a "let's see if I can do this" element.

Watching Fiddler on the Roof over Christmas break piqued my interest in the history of Jewish people. Seeing the provincial, bucolic town of Anatevka evoked a lot of Romantic feelings in me, and I became curious to read up on these types of places. I looked for the most general and well regarded history of Jews, and found [this one](http://www.amazon.com/A-History-Jews-Paul-Johnson/dp/0060915331) by Paul Johnson who I later learned is held as one of the top historians of our time. While it didn't touch much on what life in Anatevka was like, I did learn a lot from the book . . . and here's my summary and take on it!

But first, I'll complain a bit about what I didn't learn. I was really hoping to get a glimpse of a Jewish person's life throughout history. For example, what did a Jew, living in Israel under King David, do day to day? What did his house look like? What kind of food did he cook? What did he own? Did he go to school? What technologies were available to him at the time, and what did his government provide to him? What was the balance of religious Jewishness and secular/ethnic Jewishness in his life? I want to know the answer to these questions for all types of Jews - the original Jews, the Jews of the middle ages, the ghetto-ized Jews, the Jews of Anatevka and places like it, and even the Jews of far out places like China, India and Ehtiopia. Well, unfortunately this book did not satisfy my thirst for such knowledge. Maybe it's covered in some other books.

Now for what this book does cover, which is a lot. It is divided into chapters that are relatively self explanatory. It begins with Israelites, referring to the original Jewish people founded my the man who I get my last name from, Abraham (although I was actually raised Catholic). These people lived in Canaan, an area in the Southern Levant. Much of this chapter and the second chapter, Judaism, attempt to follow events in the Bible. For a religious person who wants to know the historical accuracy of certain parts of the Bible, this would be quite interesting. For me, who has limited knowledge of the Bible, it felt a bit too much like a master class and not the overview I was hoping to get. At a higher level though, these chapters get at the idea that Abraham invented ethical monotheism. This was an entirely new idea in a time where the other theology we know most about was Egyptian, with hundreds of gods and goddesses providing a quick and easy solution or origin story for all mankind's unknowns. From this, Johnson focuses on the idea of Judism as an extremely rational religion, and he keeps returning to that point throughout the book. The Jews are the chosen people of God and therefore have the responsibility of figuring out how to live in accordance to his laws. When I think about this, I see it having a major effect on how one would live their life: Instead of thinking that life is deterministic, or that we are all just actors in a play, one would instead believe that there is a right way to live, and the journey of life would be the study, discovery, and practice of this way. This leads to a lot of scholarship, a lot of focus on coming up with laws on how to live, and according to the author lays the groundwork that makes it so this ancient tribe of people survive throughout all of history.

The first few chapters also focus on a lot of history. The Kingdom of Israel, the prophets, the wars, the Babylonian exile and the flip flopping of when the Jewish people had their own land and when they lost it and were conquered people. They seemed to be well treated as conquered people, although who knows what that would look like to us. There was a lot of slavery, rape and killings in those days.

A common theme, which I'm sure happened to many ancient people, is that a neighboring group gains power, comes to your land and takes over. This causes scattering of people, and probably in many cases will exterminate a group of people. That group may just merge into another group, rather than being fully killed off, but the point is that they lose their beliefs, writings, and culture. The Jewish people, however, become very good at being conquered and still managing to hold onto their beliefs and ways of life. Although they consider Israel their land, they seem to do well scattered across Mesopotamia and although they are treated from a range of terrible to tolerated by the Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine empires, they generally do quite well, grow their population, refine their laws, and cleverly find spaces where they can act in economic life.

These chapters also discuss, briefly, the rise of Christianity, and how its growing influence and eventual takeover as the religion of the Roman Empire affected Jewish people. The author is a Christian, but doesn't spend too much time talking about that one really famous Jew who was born at the time we started the calendar back at zero.

As we learn in general history, there wasn't much interesting in the Middle Ages. However, for the Jews of Spain there was a Golden Age where they lived quite well with the Muslims and Christians. Around this time they produce one of their most famous people, [Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides). I had never heard of him before, but the author spends pages and pages on him. His light burned bright during the otherwise dull period of the middle ages, and contributed a lot to law and ethics as well as medicine. Should I decide to go deeper down this rabbit hole, I'll probably pick up a book about or by him.

Johnson describes the various uprisings, pogroms, and expulsions of Jews across Europe and the middle East from the middle ages to the 1800s, including the formation of ghettos (the name of the fourth chapter) and the evolution of antisemitism. The author explains, with many examples, how duplicitous this antisemitism was. One side of the antisemitic argument saw the Jews as this poor, mysterious, mystical, ritualistic, ancient, wandering people. People like that never faired well in medieval times. On the other side, whenever Jews became successful and prosperous, they were thought to have done so at the expense of others through some shady tactics. The governments would react to the later situation often by imposing restrictions on their participation in social and economic life, while mobs and common folk would react to the former situation by burning their homes, synagogues and rioting against them. This pushed the Jews to the fringes of both poverty and innovation/enterprise, which perpetuated the two stereotypes even more! One area of economic life that they basically had a monopoly on was money lending and issuance of credit. Both Christianity and Islam prohibited this for awhile, and even when the Enlightenment rolled around and Christians and secular gentiles in Europe got into the finance game Jews were still able to completely dominate the industry. The role of the "Court Jew" emerged. This was a Jew who worked with the government and nobility, mainly to lend money to finance wars. Many of these names we recognize today, like Oppenheimer and [Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family). These Jews were treated much differently from those in the ghetto. Again though, going back to the duplicitous nature of antisemitism, these super rich and influential Jews fanned the flames for growing conspiracy theorists that a secret society of Jews have been around for thousands of years controlling the world powers with their money. One thing I found interesting was to learn that Karl Marx was actually born a Jew, but renounced his Judaism early on and was very anti-Semitic in his early writings. Later, as his ideas became more refined, he basically replaced Jews with Capitalism in general. But early on he was targeting the Jews especially as exploiters of labor and owners of the means of production.

As the 1800s progressed, Jews became emancipated again in some parts of Europe. Indeed, the 5th chapter is called 'Emancipation'. It started in England, which gave many (but not full) rights to Jews and attracted a lot of migrants. Even the PM, David Disraeli, was of Jewish descent. However, he wasn't religiously Jewish - that would have prevented his career in politics - he was baptized early on. Jews started enjoying more freedom in France and Germany as well, and much of the culture in arts, theater, and music in Paris and Berlin (the cultural epicenters of the world at the time) came from Jews. In fact, some of the positive attitudes towards the Jews coming from intellectuals in Paris, especially during the [Dreyfus Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair) played a role in the movement of Zionism, which was led by a guy who was probably heavily featured on [My Daguerreotype Boyfriend](http://mydaguerreotypeboyfriend.tumblr.com/), [Theodor Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl).

This post is getting rather long so I'll wrap it up in a future part 2 . . .
